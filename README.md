# Algorithms
Repository to store basic algorithms for sorting, searching, etc.
As a CS major I would like to create a repo for algorithms used in class to help others understand basics of algrithms. I will be working on java and python for the moment.

It is also a repo for tech problems, some code is taken from other sources and some are mine. Normally there is the lin where I took the code but the purpose is just to learn.
